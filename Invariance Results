Invariance Results
----------------------------------------------------
Configural
All 3 constructs pass without issue
Atl (PLBS) + Cog = converges normally - fit is great
AtL (PLBS) + Prob BeH = fails to converge normally - negatives in cov.ov - fit ok to bad
  Offending indicators: "persistent"" not playing nice - negative on all axis (might be too large to fix to 0)
Prob + Cog =
