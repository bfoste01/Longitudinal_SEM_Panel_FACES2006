Invariance Results
----------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURAL
All 3 constructs pass without issue when tested indivudally
5. Atl (PLBS) + Cog = converges normally - fit is great
6. AtL (PLBS) + Cog = fails to converge normally - negatives in cov.ov - fit ok to bad
  Offending indicators: "persistent"" not playing nice - negative on all axis (might be too large to fix to 0)
7. Prob + Cog = fails to converge normally - cov.ov negative - fit is great
  Offending indicators: "WJ Ap" and "Hyper"
8. AtL (P + T + PLBS) + Cog = converges normally - fit is great
9. AtL (P + T + PLBS) + Prob = fails to converges normally - fit is good
  Offending constructs: AtL and Cog are linear codependent 

Summary: No matter how you parse the PLBS it behaves badly with the Problem BeH construct, so we know this ahead of testing for 3 factors, but suspect fit will be bad for 3 facotrs and there will be some adjustments to do
----------------------------------------------------
Three Factor
Atl (PLBS) + Cog + Prob = fails to converge normally - cv.lv is negative - fit is bad
  Offending indicators: Prob to AtL linear codependent
