Invariance Results
----------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURAL
All 3 constructs pass without issue when tested indivudally
5. Atl (PLBS) + Cog = converges normally - fit is great
6. AtL (PLBS) + Prob = fails to converge normally - negatives in cov.ov - fit ok to bad
  Offending indicators: "persistent"" not playing nice - negative on all axis (might be too large to fix to 0)
7. Prob + Cog = fails to converge normally - cov.ov negative - fit is great
  Offending indicators: "WJ Ap" and "Hyper"
8. AtL (P + T + PLBS) + Cog = converges normally - fit is great
9. AtL (P + T + PLBS) + Prob = fails to converges normally - fit is good
  Offending constructs: AtL and Cog are linear codependent 

Summary: No matter how you parse the PLBS it behaves badly with the Problem BeH construct, so we know this ahead of testing for 3 factors, but suspect fit will be bad for 3 facotrs and there will be some adjustments to do
----------------------------------------------------
Three Factor
10. Atl (PLBS) + Cog + Prob = fails to converge normally - cov.ov is negative - fit is ok
  Offending indicators: "Persist" and "withdrawn""
11. Atl (Parent + Teacher + PLBS) + Cog + Prob = fails to converge normally - cov.lv is negative - fit is good
  Offending construct: Prob and AtL are linear codependent

Summary: My hunch is that in the end AtL and Prob are going to give us issues. At this point the best way to proceed is to fix the negative variances on the diagnol of cov.ov to 0 and see how this runs. Also, I have not checked the modification indicides yet. I suspect that the indicators will cross load on AtL, specically persistent and hyperactive. If this is the case then I think we are back to drawing board with this model or trying a 2 indicator factor solution for Problem BeH, and borrowing info from other parts of the model.Another thing that might be an issue is the first lag is half a year and subsquent lags are a year. Also, I you can't model Problem BeH with a Poisson distribution, as it is a count variable. I don't think this will change things that much though, as on it's own Problem BeH fits great. The other options would be to apply a gentel ridge push (e-1.05) to the diagnol of cov.ov, but I don't suspect this would change things much either. If need to could explore non-linear inequality constraint, but I have no indication tha these variables will work together.

I predict the best way to proceede would be to look at AtL and cognitive development, maybe condition the model on Problem BeH and other variables of interst
----------------------------------------------------
Three Factor Model Modification

First, I am going to fix the negative variances of all 4 "persist" indicators
10.b.Atl (PLBS) + Cog + Prob = fails to converge normally - 
  Offending constructs: AtL and Prob BeH slight linear co-dependency in cov.lv. 

Summary: AtL and Prob does not play nice together 
----------------------------------------------------
Two factor invaraince stages with AtL and Cog

CONFIGURAL
5.  Atl (PLBS) + Cog = converges normally - fit is great(RMSEA = 0.017-0.022; CFI = 0.992; TLI = 0.988, Chi=????) PASS
WEAK (Equate the loadings across time)
5.b  Atl (PLBS) + Cog = converges normally - fit is good(RMSEA = 0.039-0.044; CFI = 0.958; TLI = 0.944, Chi=???) PASS
STRONG (Equte the means across time)
5.c  Atl (PLBS) + Cog = converges normally - fit is bad(RMSEA = 0.110-0.114; CFI = 0.676; TLI = 0.601, Chi=???) Fail
  Note. PPVT really wants to cross load. Not willing to make that sacrafice with a more simplistic model. Will try for partial invariance and/or switch to other way of defining AtL
STRICT- Is pointless
